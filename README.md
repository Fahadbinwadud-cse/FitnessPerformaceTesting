**I used Fithub site for performance testing:**

Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed the performance test on Fithub.
Test executed for the below-mentioned scenario in server [FitHub](https://fithub-snikhil2001.vercel.app/)

100 Concurrent Request with 0 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 5.1 And Total Concurrent API requested: 600.
200 Concurrent Request with 0 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 6.4  And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.
250 Concurrent Request with 0 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 16.5  And Total Concurrent API requested: 1500.
300 Concurrent Request with 0 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 19 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1800.

While executing 300 concurrent requests, I found 24 requests got connection timeout, and the error rate is 1.33%. 

Summary: The server can handle almost a concurrent 1600 API calls with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report in the attachment and let me know if you have any further queries.
